							<b>Defeasible reasoning</b> is a kind of <a href=""></a> that is
							based on reasons that are <i><a href="">defeasible</a>,</i> as
							opposed to the <i>indefeasible</i> reasons of deductive logic.
							Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non-demonstrative
							reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete,
							or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and
							corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In other words
							defeasible reasoning produces a <a href="">contingent</a>
							statement or claim. Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning
							are <a href="">probabilistic reasoning</a>, <a href="">inductive
								reasoning</a>, <a href="">statistical</a> reasoning, <a href="">abductive
								reasoning</a>, and <a href="">paraconsistent</a> reasoning.
							Defeasible reasoning is also a kind of <a href="">ampliative</a>
							reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings
							of the premises.
						</p>
						<p>The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond
							to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning
							uses, and on what premise (or on what authority) the conditional
							is adopted:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><i><a href="">Deductive</a></i> (from meaning postulate,
								axiom, or contingent assertion): if <i>p</i> then <i>q</i>
								(i.e., <i>q</i> or <i>not-p</i>)</li>
							<li><i>Defeasible</i> (from authority): if <i>p</i> then
								(defeasibly) <i>q</i></li>
							<li><i><a href="">Probabilistic</a></i> (from combinatorics
								and indifference): if <i>p</i> then (probably) <i>q</i></li>
							<li><i><a href="">Statistical</a></i> (from data and
								presumption): the frequency of <i>q</i>s among <i>p</i>s is high
								(or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right
								context) if <i>p</i> then (probably) <i>q</i></li>
							<li><i><a href="">Inductive</a></i> (theory formation; from
								data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) "if
								<i>p</i> then <i>q</i>"; hence, if <i>p</i> then
								(deducibly-but-revisably) <i>q</i></li>
							<li><i><a href="">Abductive</a></i> (from data and theory):
								<i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are correlated, and <i>q</i> is sufficient
								for <i>p</i>; hence, if <i>p</i> then (abducibly) <i>q</i> as
								cause</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Some have thought that defeasible reasoning could be
							connected to qualitative probabilistic reasoning, but such
							efforts have not borne great insights.</p>
						<p>
							Defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in <a href="">jurisprudence</a>,
							<a href="">ethics</a> and <a href="">moral philosophy</a>, <a
								href="">epistemology</a>, <a href="">pragmatics</a> and
							conversational <a href="">conventions</a> in <a href="">linguistics</a>,
							<a href="">constructivist</a> <a href="">decision theories</a>,
							and in <a href="">knowledge representation</a> and <a href="">planning</a>
							in <a href="">artificial intelligence</a>. It is also closely
							identified with <a href="">prima facie</a> (presumptive)
							reasoning (i.e., reasoning on the "face" of evidence), and <a
								href="">ceteris paribus</a> (default) reasoning (i.e.,
							reasoning, all things "being equal").

						<h2>History [edit]</h2>
						<p>
							Though <a href="">Aristotle</a> differentiated the forms of
							reasoning that are valid for <a href="">logic</a> and <a href="">philosophy</a>
							from the more general ones that are used in everyday life (see <a
								href="">dialectics</a> and <a href="">rhetoric</a>), 20th
							century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning.
							At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically
							survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often
							giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of
							<a href="">mathematical logic</a> at the hands of <a href="">Bertrand
								Russell</a>, <a href="">Alfred North Whitehead</a> and <a href="">Willard
								van Orman Quine</a>, latter-20th century logic texts paid little
							attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are several notable exceptions. <a href="">John Maynard
								Keynes</a> wrote his dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning,
							and influenced the thinking of <a href="">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>
							on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers,
							including the <a href="">positivist</a> legal scholar <a href="">H.L.A.
								Hart</a> and the <a href="">speech act</a> linguist <a href="">John
								L. Austin</a>, <a href="">Stephen Toulmin</a> in rhetoric (<a
								href="">Chaim Perelman</a> too), the moral theorists <a href="">W.D.
								Ross</a> and <a href="">C.L. Stevenson</a>, and the <a href="">vagueness</a>
							epistemologist/ontologist <a href="">Friedrich Waismann</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The etymology of <i>defeasible</i> usually refers to Middle
							English law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a
							clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though <i>defeat</i>,
							<i>dominate</i>, <i>defer</i>, <i>defy</i>, <i>deprecate</i> and
							<i>derogate</i> are often used in the same contexts as <i>defeasible,</i>
							the verbs <i>annul</i> and <i>invalidate</i> (and <i>nullify,</i>
							<i>overturn,</i> <i>rescind,</i> <i>vacate,</i> <i>repeal,</i> <i>debar</i>,
							<i>void</i>, <i>cancel</i>, <i>countermand</i>, <i>preempt</i>,
							etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of
							defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter <i>d</i>.
							Many dictionaries do contain the verb, <i>to defease</i> with
							past participle, <i>defeased.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken
							defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists
							rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject:
						<p>
							At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart
							and Austin at Oxford, <a href="">Brian Barry</a> and <a href="">David
								Gauthier</a>, were applying defeasible reasoning to political
							argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. <a
								href="">Joel Feinberg</a> and <a href="">Joseph Raz</a> were
							beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and
							jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.
						</p>
						<p>
							By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the
							mid-1970s were in epistemology, where <a href="">John Pollock</a>'s
							1974 <i>Knowledge and Justification</i> popularized his
							terminology of <i>undercutting</i> and <i>rebutting</i> (which
							mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant
							precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to
							philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss
							defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done
							to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the
							philosophical mainstream.
						</p>
						<p>
							Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument,
							rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of
							reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. <a
								href="">Nicholas Rescher</a>'s <i>Dialectics</i> is an example
							of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more
							complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because
							proponents of <a href="">informal logic</a> became the keepers of
							argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema
							to argument.
						</p>
						<p>
							About this time, researchers in <a href="">artificial
								intelligence</a> became interested in <a href="">non-monotonic
								reasoning</a> and its <a href="">semantics</a>. With philosophers
							such as Pollock and <a href="">Donald Nute</a> (e.g., <a href="">defeasible
								logic</a>), dozens of computer scientists and logicians produced
							complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000. No
							single system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same
							way that Quine's system of logic became a de facto standard.
							Nevertheless, the 100-year headstart on non-demonstrative logical
							calculi, due to <a href="">George Boole</a>, <a href="">Charles
								Sanders Peirce</a>, and <a href="">Gottlob Frege</a> was being
							closed: both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning now
							have formal calculi.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are related (and slightly competing) systems of reasoning
							that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning, e.g., <a
								href="">belief revision</a> and <a href="">dynamic logic</a>.
							The <a href="">dialogue logics</a> of <a href="">Charles
								Hamblin</a> and <a href="">Jim Mackenzie (logician)</a>, and their
							colleagues, can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning.
							Belief revision is a non-constructive specification of the
							desiderata with which, or constraints according to which,
							epistemic change takes place. Dynamic logic is related mainly
							because, like paraconsistent logic, the reordering of premises
							can change the set of justified conclusions. Dialogue logics
							introduce an adversary, but are like belief revision theories in
							their adherence to deductively consistent states of belief.

						<h2>Political and judicial use [edit]</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
							Many political philosophers have been fond of the word <i>indefeasible</i>
							when referring to rights, e.g., that were <i>inalienable,</i> <i>divine,</i>
							or <i>indubitable.</i> For example, in the 1776 <a href="">Virginia
								Declaration of Rights</a>, "community hath an indubitable,
							inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish
							government..." (also attributed to <a href="">James Madison</a>);
							and <a href="">John Adams</a>, "The people have a right, an
							indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that
							most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the
							character and conduct of their rulers." Also, <a href="">Lord
								Aberdeen</a>: "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" and
							<a href="">Gouverneur Morris</a>: "the Basis of our own
							Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People."
							Scholarship about <a href="">Abraham Lincoln</a> often cites
							these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers
							who use the word <i>defeasible</i> have historically had
							different world views from those who use the word <i>indefeasible</i>
							(and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and
							Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use
							both words.
						</p>
						<p>
							In judicial opinions, the use of <i>defeasible</i> is
							commonplace. There is however disagreement among legal logicians
							whether <i>defeasible reasoning</i> is central, e.g., in the
							consideration of <i>open texture</i>, <a href="">precedent</a>, <a
								href="">exceptions</a>, and <i>rationales</i>, or whether it
							applies only to explicit defeasance clauses. <a href="">H.L.A.
								Hart</a> in <i><a href="">The Concept of Law</a></i> gives two
							famous examples of defeasibility: "No vehicles in the park"
							(except during parades); and "Offer, acceptance, and memorandum
							produce a contract" (except when the contract is illegal, the
							parties are minors, inebriated, or incapacitated, etc.).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Specificity[edit]</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
							One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of
							defeasible reasoning is the status of a <i>rule of
								specificity.</i> In its simplest form, it is the same rule as
							subclass <a href="">inheritance</a> preempting class inheritance:
						</p>
						<p>
							(R1) if <i>p</i> then (defeasibly) <i>q</i> e.g., if penguin then
							not-flies (R2) if <i>r</i> then (defeasibly) <i>not-q</i> e.g.,
							if bird then flies (O1) if <i>p</i> then (deductively) <i>r</i>
							e.g., if penguin then bird (M1) arguably, p e.g., arguably,
							penguin (M2) R1 is a more specific reason than R2 e.g., R1 is
							better than R2 (M3) therefore, arguably, q e.g., therefore,
							arguably, not-flies
						</p>
						<p>
							Approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning
							discussed today adopt a rule of specificity, while half expect
							that such <i>preference</i> rules be written explicitly by
							whoever provides the defeasible reasons. For example, Rescher's
							dialectical system uses specificity, as do early systems of
							multiple inheritance (e.g., <a href="">David Touretzky</a>) and
							the early argument systems of <a href="">Donald Nute</a> and of <a
								href="">Ronald Loui</a>. Defeasible reasoning accounts of
							precedent (<a href="">stare decisis</a> and <a href="">case-based
								reasoning</a>) also make use of specificity (e.g., <a href="">Joseph
								Raz</a> and the work of <a href="">Kevin D. Ashley</a> and <a
								href="">Edwina Rissland</a>). Meanwhile, the argument systems of
							<a href="">Henry Prakken</a> and <a href="">Giovanni Sartor</a>,
							of <a href="">Bart Verheij</a> and <a href="">Jaap Hage</a>, and
							the system of <a href="">Phan Minh Dung</a> do not adopt such a
							rule.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Nature of defeasibility[edit]</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>
							There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about
							defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational
							revision (with affinities to <a href="">belief revision</a>), and
							those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result
							of further (non-empirical) investigation. There are at least
							three kinds of further non-empirical investigation: progress in a
							lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process,
							and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i><b>Defeasibility as corrigibility:</b></i> Here, a person
							learns something new that annuls a prior inference. In this case,
							defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief
							revision, like a <a href="">truth maintenance system</a> as
							envisioned by Jon Doyle.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i><b>Defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions:</b></i> Here,
							the author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules
							with exceptions. Sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be
							rewritten, with more cogency, with explicit (local)
							pre-conditions instead of (non-local) competing rules. Many
							non-monotonic systems with <a href="">fixed-point</a> or <a
								href="">preferential</a> semantics fit this view. However,
							sometimes the rules govern a process of argument (the last view
							on this list), so that they cannot be re-compiled into a set of
							deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with
							incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i><b>Defeasibility as an <a href="">anytime
										algorithm</a>:
							</b></i> Here, it is assumed that calculating arguments takes time, and
							at any given time, based on a subset of the potentially
							constructible arguments, a conclusion is defeasibly justified. <a
								href="">Isaac Levi</a> has protested against this kind of
							defeasibility, but it is well-suited to the heuristic projects
							of, for example, <a href="">Herbert A. Simon</a>. On this view,
							the <i>best move so far</i> in a chess-playing program's analysis
							at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion. This
							interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical
							view.
						</p>
						<p>
							<i><b>Defeasibility as a means of controlling an
									investigative or social process:</b></i> Here, justification is the
							result of the right kind of procedure (e.g., a fair and efficient
							hearing), and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and
							con responses to each other. Defeasibility has to do with the
							alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented,
							not the changing of a mind with respect to new (empirical)
							discovery. Under this view, defeasible reasoning and defeasible
							argumentation refer to the same phenomenon.
